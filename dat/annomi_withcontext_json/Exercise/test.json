I know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that I've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button. I think I saw something like that on TV."},"681":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Mm-hmm. -gonna say a six."},"8957":{"polarity":"change","sentence":"Um, well, if I'm trying to walk outside, the weather's always going to be one, but I, again, like I said, if I'm checking, uh, using the app on my phone to see my step count, I can maybe make more of a priority to walk indoors, um, and just find places inside that I could walk, even if it's just around the hallway or whatever that looks like-"},"112":{"polarity":"change","sentence":"I guess it's because I know that I need to do it to lose the weight."},"2649":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Right.

It's really nice to see you again. I see you're back to follow up on the stroke you had. How are things going for you at the rehab facility? [signs] Kind of slow."},"8234":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Yeah, that's certainly understandable. We both know that there's a lot that plays into weight management, but there's no need to figure it all out today, especially since things are so busy for you right now. Maybe we could put our heads together and think about something small that fits reasonably into your life and then we can take further steps when you're ready. Okay, that sounds great. So, what should I do?"},"2657":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Oh, okay. So I\u2014"},"3667":{"polarity":"change","sentence":"Yeah. -I-I am.

Diet, the D word."},"7349":{"polarity":"sustain","sentence":"Yeah. It's been a little-little hectic, you know. And, uh-- But, I-I don't like it too much because there's all these younger guys that can lift a lot more weight than me or they can stay on the treadmill longer and it-it-it's a little discouraging, you know.

Okay, yeah."},"6448":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"-to something on to some-- and-and so it's not a wasted interview. So I can come here and say, okay, I've looked at my schedules, I've looked at things-"},"1688":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Absolutely, I appreciate you sharing that piece with me and you absolutely get to have that desire. And, um, we certainly are bombarded all day long with messages about how a body is supposed to look and so we all, um, certainly have moments of feeling dissatisfied with how our bodies look. And so you're absolutely, um, welcome to hold that and we can have space for that and you can certainly talk about that in these sessions. And I'll check in with you as we're going through the process of behavior change, um, to see how your body confidence is, um, as we talk more. Great. Yeah, now that sounds good."},"6390":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Yeah. I've got a pile of work-"},"3593":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Yeah, right.

Thank you."},"3816":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Oh yeah, yeah, it doesn't do any good to just try to injure your- injure yourself especially when you're a bit normal like me."},"3535":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Uh, well, I'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute, and it just feels good to be home."},"3597":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and-- Yeah."},"8943":{"polarity":"change","sentence":"Yeah. I think, you know, finding ways to walk more would be good, um, even if that is inside somewhere. Uh, I've done the like trick of parking in the back of the parking lot and walking up to the store. Um, and like I've also been in Target and taken an extra lap, which is kind of dangerous too 'cause you might spend more money. Um, but I- I think if the weather's nice too, I would like to get outside and try to find a place to walk. Um, and two, I really did enjoy yoga, it's- it was good for my, like, flexibility and posture, and so I would be interested in maybe seeing too what classes are available in the area. I haven't looked at that at all."},"1484":{"polarity":"change","sentence":"Okay, and how come not at like a five or a six?

Yeah, I think so."},"1653":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Um, I definitely, uh, you know, I-I strive to be physically healthy, but I also have in my life seeing how that impacts me mentally. Um, so I think if I'm- if I'm able to do the things that I wanna do and, um, you know, that I'm feeling good about where I'm at mentally, then that's kind of my end goal, always. Um, yeah, so this body dissatisfaction piece has really just kinda thrown a wrench in that and it's been enough of a challenge that I thought I should seek out someone who can really help me through that piece."},"7238":{"polarity":"sustain","sentence":"I just need to find the time to do it. And, yes, I might be lacking a little bit of motivation, but I think it's more timing and trying to fit it in."},"3663":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Mm-hmm.

Well, I look forward to checking in with you, and thanks so much for coming in. Thanks for having me. All right."},"8230":{"polarity":"change","sentence":"Yeah, I suppose. I know my weight is a problem, but every time I try to take it off, I end up gaining it back. I don't know what to do."},"3669":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Yeah. Yeah. Well, we can definitely talk about it when you come in again like- Okay."},"1655":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Yeah. Well, I'm so glad that you reached out for help, um, and just know that you're not alone.

Yes, please."},"3629":{"polarity":"change","sentence":"So, um, is there, yeah, like a support somehow?

I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi."},"6384":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"And, I- I'm sorry about the wait in the waiting room.
