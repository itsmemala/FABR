Yes."},"4318":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"-to ask are they\u2014 Yeah."},"7641":{"polarity":"change","sentence":"Mm. So smoking pot with your peers to try to fit in more but it doesn't seem to be making you feel more comfortable with your friends. Uh, yeah."},"4316":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Right. And they got questions too- Yeah."},"2540":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":" Pretty good. It's been three months now."},"4371":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"That creates problems? Yeah."},"3482":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Okay. How often do you use new deals when you inject? Yeah, I use new needles every time, I never share."},"4290":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"So you're worried a little bit about it and you're going to find out more about it, but you're-you're not gonna take on this notion of being a headache or anything as yet\u2014 Yeah."},"4179":{"polarity":"change","sentence":"Yeah. I just sort of did a bit of search on the internet and stuff and just read about this place, so I just thought I'll\u2014"},"2552":{"polarity":"change","sentence":"So-so, uh, have-- last time we talked, you know, you were kind of cutting the-the ex-boyfriend out. This is because he was your dealer, so-- Right."},"5869":{"polarity":"sustain","sentence":"You seem motivated to follow the rules. Mm-hmm. I still crave smoking, even though I've stopped."},"3514":{"polarity":"change","sentence":"I would really like a little bit of information on, uh, injecting in my arm."},"4240":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"No. I didn't really know. I guess you see sort of things like that in-in movies from America you know, but you don't really-"},"4341":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"So it's provided you don't-- you're not stupid with it. Then it's just a bit of fun but you can't really explain that to people who are-- have their walls up. So it's hard not to sit in this room full of people kind of going, \"Oh, you know, you really should stop the drugs, they're bad.\" It's like, \"Well actually, you don't know what you're talking about.\""},"7630":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Well, yeah. The truth is I'm the first in my family to go to college so I don't know, I guess, I'm in a bit over my head."},"5871":{"polarity":"sustain","sentence":"It's something that's always on your mind. I still crave smoking, even though I've stopped."},"4219":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Okay.

I suppose just since that kind of intervention thing or I started to give them the benefit of the doubt.

Yep."},"4225":{"polarity":"change","sentence":"Mm-hmm, yeah. Yeah. So I guess when I put it that way, it does sound quite a lot, but it doesn't feel a lot, you know? If you know what I mean?"},"3474":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Thanks. Just so you know, when I talk to patients about drug use, my job is to be helpful. I'm not going to tell you what to do or what you should do. What I can do is share some information and be a resource. Does that make sense? Uh, yeah, that's fine."},"7628":{"polarity":"sustain","sentence":"Yeah. I mean, I'm here on an academic scholarship so I have to keep my grades up and I'm on the debate team, so there's a lot going on."},"4397":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"So that I can pursue that plan. Mm-hmm."},"4385":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"So there is a possibility that there are other parts of the scene that don't rely on drug use- Yeah."},"3494":{"polarity":"sustain","sentence":"Uh, you know, I get loaded and I-I can- I can function. I can go to work and, you know, do normal things, you know. Uh, I mean, there's been maybe just a couple of times where I wasn't feeling all that well, and I, uh, I was late a couple of times to work or it might overslept from the night before or whatever, but it's about it. Uh, I just want to avoid getting sick right now. That's my main priority."},"3508":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Where do you keep it? Uh, at home mostly."},"4409":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Yeah. -hang out and have a good time."},"6008":{"polarity":"change","sentence":"Still have a wife and, uh, yeah, if I-- If those two things can happen then, you know\u2014"},"4970":{"polarity":"sustain","sentence":"Yeah. I feel alone, and I just, I miss her and, it does- it does help but,-"},"4365":{"polarity":"change","sentence":"Yeah, and then I suppose also like money is linked into that as well, you know, I've-- I'm not doing as many courses and stuff as I used to be doing, 'cause it's, you know, don't have the money."},"4334":{"polarity":"change","sentence":"And that's a problem? That would be a problem, yeah."},"7639":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"So how is it working to help you fit in? I'm not sure it is."},"3468":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Thanks. When I looked at your form, it looks like you use heroin weekly and you injected. What part of your body do you normally inject in? Uh, mostly in my left arm."},"4169":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Have you been here before? No. No, not at all."},"4399":{"polarity":"change","sentence":"Well, [coughs] I must say I was a bit, um, you know, at the start when I was sort of saying I, you know, this is how often I do it and then I found myself talking about the kind of the weekday stuff I kinda took myself back a bit there. I suppose, you know, on a Wednesday by yourself like it doesn't sound that good."},"6004":{"polarity":"change","sentence":"-If I lose my job, it's 'cause I failed the UA, so\u2014"},"4155":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Well, great.

Yeah, pretty right."},"5865":{"polarity":"sustain","sentence":"You're willing to take steps to improve on that. Mm-hmm. I really want to get off the program."},"4175":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Right. Yeah."},"3524":{"polarity":"change","sentence":"Um, well, I can talk to my housemate tomorrow night. I'm pretty sure that he doesn't work tomorrow night so he'll be around."},"7632":{"polarity":"sustain","sentence":"I've always been an anxious person. Pot just helps me calm my nerves. I'm I in trouble?"},"6006":{"polarity":"change","sentence":"Okay. Um, so can you talk to me a little bit about, um, maybe where you wanna be 90 days from now? What do you want your life to look like? I'll still have a job."},"4401":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"So that needs some thinking about, doesn't it? Yeah."},"4103":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Let's take a look. It says that on occasion you use, uh, drugs other than medical reasons. Which drugs do you use? I do some meth."},"3496":{"polarity":"sustain","sentence":"Um, well, you know, I like the way it feels.

I really shouldn't have done it."},"5982":{"polarity":"change","sentence":"Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high."},"4302":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"Sure. [chuckling] It's not a secure profession- No."},"4419":{"polarity":"neutral","sentence":"-you know, good to know about and-and-and maybe in-- within those options or something you might say, \"Oh yeah, I'd give that a go. Have a look.\" Yeah. Yep."},"4312":{"polarity":"change","sentence":"-or if I actually am tired or run down, I suppose.
